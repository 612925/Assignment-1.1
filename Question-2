3 V's of Big Data: 
Volume
We are witnessing a rapid and exponential growth in datas including media(Photos/Videos),As mentioned in the session Facebook
colelcts more than hundred billion photos,growing at 7 petabytes of data everyday.With attributes like geo-tagging and ratings, useful infomation
is collected which forms the base of big data.
As the name Big Data suggests, it is easy to have terabytes and petabytes of data flowing in/out everyday. 
A simple information such as Atm swipes is analyzed at various angles and saved in different formats and different purposes.
For example: A person uses atm every 3 days at petrol bunks, this data is useful for introduction of offers/schemes that 
would attract customers of this type.

Velocity
A simple example for this would be news feed in facebook, it is quite astonishing to see how many posts are generated even for a 
person having 300 friends and liked 10-20 pages.
Not only on social media,the velocity of data accumulation is higher in banking and so many other applicaitons.

Variety
With CCTVs/Mobile Apps/Gps, it is not neccessarily that data comes in only text format. It is one of the key feature of big data system 
to handle the variety and make it meaningful for the organisation.

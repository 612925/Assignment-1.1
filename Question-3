Horizontal Scaling and Vertical Scaling:
Vertical Scaling :
When data capacity (say 1TB) is increased to handle a higher volume of data(Say 50TB), or RAM/Processor of the system
is increased/improved for a Single System. There is no need management but cost is very high and high risk of data loss.
Horizontal Scaling:
When multiple systems are introduced/adopted to handle higher volume of data or to improve the performance,it is said to be 
horizontally scaled. The processing speed is very high since data is distributed over large of number of CPUs.
There is a necessity to manage the architecture of the multiple instances.

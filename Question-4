Need and Working of Hadoop:
When datas are to be stored on different instances, it is very tedious for a human to manage all the system and 
becomes impossible for him to analyze the data stored. A framework which is capable of overcoming these odds is inevitable.
Hadoop is one such framework which is open source, reliable and scalable.

Working of Hadoop:
It is based on Google File System.
It has its own distributed file system called as Hadoop Distributed File System or HDFS, which
enhances fast data transfer between the distributed computers.
A Distributed computation framework called MapReduce is responsible for analyzing/processing of datas.

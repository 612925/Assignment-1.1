Various sources of Big Data:
As  Eric Schmidt said Every two days now, we create as muchinformation as we did from the dawn of civilization up until 2003,
so it is evident that source for big data is humongous and has a lot of variety.
Right from a hair pin to a villa we buy, everything we buy or attempt to buy is being recorded, analyzed and a strategy is made out of it.
Also all these datas does not come in a specific structure or form(Can be Media/logs/Docs).   
Sources of big data cannot be confused with applications of big data. Applications of Big Data are those general 
sectors/Domains(Such as Banking,HealthCare, Telecommunications,Research) where Big Data is used to take decisions or manage data,
but a source is entirely different.
--Sensor datas,Media,Social Media,Mobile Applications/Business Applications,Archives and Logs-- can be some of the key sources for 
organisation. The Sources of the big data can be specific to the organisation or their strategy.
